### Antimicrobial Resistance

I'm a Senior Health Economist that has been researching the burden (human and monetary) of Antimicrobial Resistance and Drug Resistant Infections for six years, focusing on antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria. I currently hold a Senior Infectious Disease Modeller post at Public Health England alongside an Honorary Research Fellow post at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine, where I previously held a post-doc position. I've worked on national-level and global burden analyses, utilising literature review, statistical modelling and mathematical modelling methods. My current research streams attempt to estimate burden from both public health and One Health perspectives. 

I'm currently building this website - soon it will house some handy links to my research (including useful infographics and brief summaries). Stay tuned!


### Health Economics & R

I'm keen on utilising R within health economics, pushing open-access and transparent modelling approaches. I'll be building this personal website to incorporate useful code and resources for this. For now please see the website I co-created compiling health economics R packages: [SHEPRD](https://hermes-sheprd.netlify.app/)
