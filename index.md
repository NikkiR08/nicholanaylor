### Introduction 

I'm a Senior Health Economist researching the costs of Antimicrobial Resistance and Drug Resistant Infections. I currently hold a Senior Infectious Disease Modeller post at Public Health England alongside an Honorary Research Fellow post at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine, where I previously held a post-doc position.
