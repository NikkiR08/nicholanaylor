### Antimicrobial Resistance

I'm a Senior Health Economist that has been researching the burden (human and monetary) of Antimicrobial Resistance and Drug Resistant Infections for six years, focusing on antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria. I currently hold a Senior Infectious Disease Modeller post at Public Health England alongside an Honorary Research Fellow post at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine, where I previously held a post-doc position. I've worked on national-level and global burden analyses, utilising literature review, statistical modelling and mathematical modelling methods. My current research streams attempt to estimate burden from both public health and One Health perspectives. 


### Health Economics & R

I'm keen on utilising R within health economics, pushing open-access and transparent modelling approaches. I'll be building this personal website to incorporate useful code and resources for this. For now please see the website I co-created compiling health economics R packages:
